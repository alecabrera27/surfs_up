Analysis of weather of Oahu, to open a business using jupyter notebook and SQLite
---

## Overview

We want to open a surfboard and ice cream shop in Oahu and to get investors to back up this project, we are putting together a business plan that will include an analysis of the weather dataset of the island.

## Results

This data analysis gives us a summary of different statistics for the temperature in the months of June and December in the island of Oahu.

### For June: 
- Total number of data: 1700
- Maximum Temperature: 85
- Minimum Temperature: 64
- Average Temperature: 74

We can see more information here:

### For December: 
- Total number of data: 1517
- Maximum Temperature: 83
- Minimum Temperature: 56
- Average Temperature: 71

## Summary

Looking at both tables, we can conclude that there is not much difference in temperatures from summer and winter at the island, there is just a slightly decrease of degrees but it won't affect the tourism, with that we can have confidence that there wonâ€™t be much decrease in sales on winter.

If we would like to provide a visual report of this analysis, it is convenient to convert this to a dataframe using pandas.
Convert to DataFrame : 
```
df = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=['tobs'])
and create a Histogram to visualize: 
df.plot.hist(bins=12)
plt.tight_layout()
```
As extra analysis, it would be convenient to find what wat the minimum, maximum and average temperature of each month with the following query:  
```
min_max_avg = session.query(func.min(Measurement.tobs), func.max(Measurement.tobs), func.avg(Measurement.tobs))
```
